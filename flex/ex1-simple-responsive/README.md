Simple FLEX responsive example - 3 images in Flex container - row direction, first image smallest one - on the left side. 
The first image remains centered in the cell by changing the size of window. 
Wrapping is implemented (images are "skipping down" when becomes flex container too small)- flex-wrap: wrap;
